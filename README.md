# Bangla-deep-speech-Recognition
Bangla deep speech recognition is a deep bidirectional RNN based bangla speech to text transcription system.
Major focusing for this project is to empower industrial application like searching a product by voice command using bangla speech recognition  end to end model, via an easy-to-use, efficient, smaller and scalable implementation, including training, inference & testing module,and deployment.

# Dataset  
This is own collected dataset and voice corpus generated on based of company product.Here I'am used a small size of voice corpuses like size 40-50 audio files.I can add more voice corpuses to get better result without overfitting.

# Annotation Tools

# Model  
1)rnn model,Lstm model,bidirectional-rnn model,Deep model  
2)working on Rnn_Transducer_model on going

# Dependency    
 Python 3.7   
 tensorflow 2.0.0
