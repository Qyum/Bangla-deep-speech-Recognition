# Bangla-deep-speech-Recognition
Bangla deep speech is a deep bidirectional RNN based bangla speech recogntion system.
My major focusing for this project is to empower industrial application like searching a product by voice command on bangla speech recognition  end to end model, via an easy-to-use, efficient, smaller and scalable implementation, including training, inference & testing module,and deployment.
